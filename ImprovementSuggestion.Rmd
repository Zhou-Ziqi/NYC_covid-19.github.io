data = Junedata %>% filter(day == "2020-06-05")

# Factor the basic variables that
# we're interested in
data$borough_group <- as.factor(data$borough_group)

library(boot)
library(table1)
tab1 = table1(~ positive + covid_case_rate + covid_death_count + covid_death_rate | borough_group ,
               data = data,
               total = FALSE,
               caption = paste0("date: ",data$day[1]))

  knitr::kable(tab1)

 
        data = Junedata[as.character(Junedata$day) %in% as.character("2020-06-01"),]
