### About the asthma

### About the zip code of New York City

"A ZIP Code doesnâ€™t actually refer to an area, but rather a collection of points that make up a mail delivery route. Furthermore, there are some buildings that have their own ZIP Code, and some non-residential areas with ZIP Codes. To deal with the challenges of ZIP Codes, the Health Department uses ZCTAs which solidify ZIP codes into units of area. Often, data reported by ZIP code are actually mapped by ZCTA. The ZCTA geography was developed by the U.S. Census Bureau.

Modified ZCTA combines census blocks with smaller populations to allow more stable estimates of population size for rate calculation."


### NTA

Neighborhood names represent the Neighborhood Organizing Census Committee boundaries(https://www1.nyc.gov/site/census/index.page), which were recently developed by the U.S. Census Bureau with input from community groups.
