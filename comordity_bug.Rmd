# data source
asthma at NTA level

or
```{r}
asthma = read.csv("./data/Asthma Emergency Department Visits (Adults) by NTA.csv",skip = 12) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(x2012_2014 == "2012-2014") %>% 
  rename(geotypename = borough,
         year = x2012_2014,
         borough = staten_island,
         neighborhood_name = staten_island_1,
         id = x5,
         average_annual_age_adjusted_rate = x77_7,
         average_annual_number = x2_773,
         average_annual_rate = x75_3) %>%

map nta data source


```{r}
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
my_spdf <- readOGR( 
  dsn= paste0("./data/nynta_20b") , 
  layer="TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3",
  verbose=FALSE
)

shp <- readOGR(dsn = "./data/nynta_20b/nynta.shp", stringsAsFactors = F)
shp@data

#however this step did not work.
data_as = geo_join(shp,asthma,"NTAName","neighborhood_name")


#then we could use the data and the ggplot function to draw the map
library(broom)
spdf_fortified <- tidy(shp)



```

we want to use geo_join to add the asthma data into the map data so that we could draw a map. However, I could not succeed.

Or we could use other method to draw this map.
